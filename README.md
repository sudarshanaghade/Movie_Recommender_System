# Movie_Recommender_System
Project Title: Movie Recommender System

Description:
This project builds a Movie Recommender System using Python. It analyzes movie data and recommends movies to users based on similarity scores. The system uses techniques like content-based filtering and cosine similarity to find and suggest movies that are most similar to a selected one. Built with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Numpy, it's a lightweight and effective recommendation engine.
